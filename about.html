<h1>Results Tidyup &ndash; About</h1>

<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p><a href="index.html" target="_blank">Results Tidyup</a> is an application that can be used to
    adjust and tidy up results data at parkrun events or similar.  It offers the ability to read in timer and
    scanner files, make some adjustments to them and download the adjusted files.</p>

<h2>What can it do?</h2>
<p>Results Tidyup can do the following:</p>

<h4>Timer operations</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Compare and merge times in two timer files, including adjusting for offsets between the two timers.</li>
    <li>Adding an offset to or subtracting an offset from times on one or both timers.</li>
    <li>Applying a scale factor to all times, either using a specified scale factor or the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Riegel#Race_time_prediction">Riegel formula</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Token operations</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Insert or remove one or more tokens, e.g. due to funnel duckers or tokens not being given out.</li>
    <li>Swap two ranges of tokens that were given out in the wrong order (e.g. 26-50 and 51-75 in
        1-25, 51-75, 26-50, 76-100, ...).</li>
    <li>Reverse a range of tokens given out in reverse order.</li>
</ul>
<p>Timer and scanner files can be loaded into Results Tidyup by using the 'Upload Files' button, or by using the
    'Paste...' button and pasting in the contents of a file.  Files can also be loaded by dragging them into the
    browser window, but note that some antivirus browser plugins can block this.</p>

<p>You can also upload a combination of timer and scanner files, and it can perform checks on all of them in combination,
    in particular ensuring that there are enough times for all of the finishers.</p>

<p>Results Tidyup works entirely within your browser.  It does not send any of the files you upload to the servers
    it is hosted on.  Your browser may report that the site is 'Not secure', but that 'Not secure' label just means
    that any data you send to the servers for processing isn't encrypted.  With Results Tidyup, there is no data
    sent to the servers, encrypted or otherwise.</p>

<h2>What can't it do?</h2>
<p>Results Tidyup cannot possibly solve every single problem with parkrun results. It can assist with identifying
    some of them, but ultimately, the adjustments have to be made with some understanding from the volunteers about
    what actually happened on the morning.</p>

<p>Results Tidyup also won't be able to display athlete names, it will only display barcode numbers.  The names are
    stored only on parkrun's systems.  I know of no way to query parkrun's systems and retrieve names for a bunch of
    athlete barcodes.  Even if there was a way, there would almost certainly be privacy concerns with doing this.
</p>

<p>Results Tidyup cannot handle more than two timer files.  (It can handle any number of barcode-scanner files,
    though.)</p>

<h2>Has this tool been adapted to work with the changes to parkrun results processing, in particular the mandatory
    use of the Virtual Volunteer app?</h2>

<p>Yes.  Results Tidyup was originally written before these changes came in but it has been updated since then.
    It can read timer files downloaded from WebFMS: they are in a different format to the timer files obtained
    in the past from Junsd stopwatches and other similar devices.</p>

<p>Results Tidyup can also handle some problems that are less likely to show up nowadays:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Results Tidyup can identify sequences of athlete and token barcodes scanned the wrong way around.
        However, the Virtual Volunteer app will ensure that athlete barcodes are scanned before finish tokens,
        so this problem will no longer occur.</li>
    <li>Scanner files contain the time at which the scan was recorded.  Results Tidyup uses these times to
        detect barcodes scanned before the event started, e.g. due to a volunteer doing some practice scans
        before the event but not clearing the scanner before scanning the 'real' barcodes of event finishers.
        This is less likely to happen with the Virtual Volunteer app, as it's more obvious how to clear it.</li>
    <li>Related to the previous point, scanning is now done on smartphones that will automatically adjust for
        daylight-saving time.  With the Opticon scanners, the clocks on these were only adjusted after you
        downloaded the scans off of them, so the times would be an hour out the first event after a
        daylight-savings time change.  Results Tidyup would flag this and offer the ability to correct the
        scan times.  Note however that WebFMS appears to ignore the scan times.  Adjusting them is only useful
        to be sure there are no problems with practice scans that should have been cleared.</li>
</ul>

<h2>There are other comparison sites such as <a href="http://stopwatch.megson.org">Steve Megson's tool</a>.
    Why should I use Results Tidyup instead?</h2>

<p>Results Tidyup compares times in a similar way to Steve Megson's tool, but it features a different
    way to detect time offsets between timers, e.g. due to one of them being started late.  If it detects an offset
    between two timers, it also allows the correction to be applied to either timer, i.e. by adding the offset to
    all times on one timer or subtracting it from all times on the other stopwatch.  It is arguable
    that most offsets between timers are caused by one of them starting late, but there are occasions where it
    seems one was started early. (I have seen one set of timer files where it seems this did happen.)</p>

<p>Steve Megson's tool can detect time offsets in some situations, but this only seems to work if the offset is
    present in the first times in each file.  If the first time is missing on one timer, or is off by a
    different offset (I have seen both cases happen), it doesn't detect the offset.  Results Tidyup is more
    resilient to such situations and will continue to detect the offset regardless of whether the first time
    has additional problems.</p>

<p>It is perhaps worth noting however that there was an alternative timer comparison tool.  This was at
    <a href="http://www.craighenderson.co.uk/parkrun/">http://www.craighenderson.co.uk/parkrun/</a>, but this appears
    to have closed.  For what it's worth, this closure seems recent (spring-summer 2021): I was aware it didn't work
    with the new-format timer files downloaded from WebFMS.  I did contact the site author to let him know this,
    and sent him a couple of timer files, but it seems he chose to close the tool down rather than adjust it.
